# 🎉 WellTrack MVP — Foundation Complete!

## Summary

I've successfully completed the foundational architecture for your WellTrack MVP. The project now has a solid foundation with complete database design, infrastructure as code, type safety, and core utilities.

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **Database Architecture** (`docs/database-schema.md`)
- 9 DynamoDB tables with proper indexes
- Complete access patterns documented
- Security and encryption enabled
- Audit logging support

### 2. **Infrastructure as Code** (`infra/terraform/`)
- Terraform configuration for AWS deployment
- DynamoDB tables with GSIs
- S3 bucket with versioning and lifecycle policies
- IAM roles with least-privilege access
- Development user credentials

### 3. **Type System**
- Complete TypeScript interfaces (`types/index.ts`)
- Zod validation schemas (`lib/schemas.ts`)
- Full type safety across the application

### 4. **Core Libraries**
- **DynamoDB Client** (`lib/db.ts`) — CRUD operations and queries
- **S3 Client** (`lib/s3.ts`) — File upload/download with presigned URLs
- **RBAC System** (`lib/permissions.ts`) — Role-based access control

### 5. **Documentation**
- Setup guide (`docs/SETUP.md`)
- Development progress tracker (`docs/PROGRESS.md`)
- Project status (`docs/project-status.md`)
- Terraform deployment guide (`infra/terraform/README.md`)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today/Tomorrow)

1. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   cd infra/terraform
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   - Create `frontend/.env.local` with AWS credentials
   - Use Terraform outputs to populate values

4. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Development Roadmap

1. **Week 1-2: Authentication**
   - NextAuth.js setup
   - User registration/login
   - Session management

2. **Week 2-3: Organizations**
   - Organization CRUD APIs
   - Member invitations
   - RBAC implementation

3. **Week 3-5: Core Features**
   - Projects, Wells, Stages, Events
   - File upload system
   - Timeline/Calendar view

4. **Week 5-6: Polish & Testing**
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Testing and bug fixes
   - Production deployment
